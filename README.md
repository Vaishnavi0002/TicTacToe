# TicTacToe
Hello!  Sharing my first android application. It's a TIC TAC TOE game.  
The application has two options:  •2 player (Player Vs Player)  •1 player (Player Vs Computer)  
It has 2 players, marking their spaces turn after turn in a 3x3 grid. 
The player who successfully places its 3 consecutive symbols in vertical/horizontal/diagonal row wins the game. 
Either X is the winner OR 0 is the winner OR Match Drawn. 
TwoActivity.java & activity_two.xml has code for Player vs Player. 
SingleActivity.java & activity_single.xml has code for Player vs Computer. 
MainActivity.java & activity_main.xml has code for start page.
